# Neuro Assistant
In this work, a neuro-employee was created, which provides information about the IT field. The knowledge base is based on the choice of a profession in the IT Yandex Practicum. The documents are an introduction to the course for those who want to start a career in IT. They explain how the course works, provide up-to-date information about the IT job market, and dispel stereotypes about the need for technical education and the age requirement for working in this field. The course offers support and assistance in finding employment, as well as insights into the latest trends in the IT industry. Using ready-made queries, you can get answers about professions such as designer and Data Science. This code includes logging, checking for correct input, and security measures.
